# Michael Newham's Resume Project

This resume website serves four seperate pages - all linked by a central navbar. These pages are index, resume, projects and contact. A seperate link on the navbar provides access to a downloadable PDF version of the printed resume. Both the 'header' and 'footer' segments remain the same throughout, while the 'section' segment changes with each page.

I chose example idea 3 - 'Build a Personal Portfolio Site' as the project for my first milestone.  The original Code Institute 'Mini Project with Bootstap 4' template was used for this. Extensive changes were made for my own version - with an extra page, update codebases, styling and iconography.
 
## UX
### Who is the website for?
#### User-Type > Recruiters
My Resume / Personal Portfolio site is aimed at recruiters who are looking at employing or contracting a person with the appropiate skill-set.

#### User-Type > Mid-Level Managers
The site is also geared toward the needs of managers in mid-sized companies / multi-nationals who wish to recruit directly from the market.

### What is it that they want to achieve?
Both recruiters & managers want to assess quickly the work & skills background of any potential candidate they would like to call for interview. They want to see a clear layout, understandable navigation and a link to download a much more comprehenive witten CV / Resume.

### How my 'project' helps recruiters.
THere is only four pages on my Resume site, each based on a CSS Grid patteern of 2 boxes for the top segment, 4 boxes for the navbar, 2 boxes for the detailed section in the middle and a final box for the footer at the end.

All information pertaining to contact details, about me, work / skill history, details concerning projects all all formatted according to the 'bootstrap' CSS styles which they all employ.

All this serves to ensure that both recruiters & managers can make a quick decision as to what engagement (if any) they may wish to undertake.

### Wireframes
I used **[www.Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)** to create multiple wireframes for the devices listed below. 'Wireframe' was easy to use and avoided the complicated install that 'balsamiq' would have required on my linux laptop.

#### - iPhone
iPhone size was 375px * 667px.
Link to an example iPhone wireframe for the **[contact page is here.](https://github.com/MichaelNewham/CI-Milestone-1_Michael_Newham_Resume/blob/master/wireframes/4-Wireframe_iPhone_Contact-html-Mid_Section-.png)** 

### - iPad
iPad / Tablet size was 1024px * 768px.
Link to an example iPad wireframe for the **[projects page is here](https://github.com/MichaelNewham/CI-Milestone-1_Michael_Newham_Resume/blob/master/wireframes/3-Wireframe_iPad_Projects-html.png)**.

### - Laptop
Average laptop size used was 1440*900.

All wireframes for the above devices can also be directly accessed at the following GitHub Pages link >

### Features Left to Implement
- I would like to increase the contrast of the pages so that they are more 'readable' by those with impaired vision.




## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
